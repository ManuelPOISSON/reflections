What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It creates a .git file.
No commit.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
the staging area is something between both. It allows to commit little by little when you change many files without commiting.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
git diff compare working directory and staging area
git diff --staged compare the commit we're on and staging area
Comparing a commit to its parent
git show commit_id

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
